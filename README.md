### **Titanic Machine Learning Project** 🚢

The **Titanic Machine Learning Project** utilizes the famous Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features like age, gender, class, and others. This project highlights the use of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and different classification algorithms.

#### **Key Steps:**

1. **📊 Data Collection**  
   The Titanic dataset is sourced from Kaggle, containing data on passengers' personal information, survival status, and more.

2. **🔧 Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical features  
   - Normalize numerical data

3. **📉 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize survival rates by gender, class, age, etc.  
   - Analyze the distribution of the dataset and identify correlations.

4. **🧠 Model Building**  
   - Applied machine learning algorithms:  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Decision Trees  
     - Random Forests

5. **🔍 Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluate models using:
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision  
   - Recall  
   - F1-Score

6. **🌐 Deployment (Optional)**  
   Deploy the model using Flask or similar frameworks for live predictions.
